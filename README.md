## Customer Churn Prediction

[Link to the Project](./Customer%20Churn%20Prediction)

### Description:
In this project, the goal was to predict customer churn for a telecom operator, Interconnect. By predicting whether a client is likely to leave, the company can offer special promotions to retain them. This project involved data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and building machine learning models to predict churn, with a primary focus on the AUC-ROC metric.

### Key Insights:
- **Target Feature**: Whether the customer has left or not.
- **Primary Metric**: AUC-ROC with a target of 0.88 or higher.
- **Tools and Models**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting.

## Data Analysis and Hypothesis Testing for Rideshare Company

[Link to the Project](./Data%20Analysis%20and%20Hypothesis%20Testing%20for%20Rideshare%20Company)

### Description:
Zuber, a new ride-sharing company in Chicago, tasked me with analyzing ride data and testing a hypothesis on whether weather conditions impact ride durations. This project involved SQL queries to extract, transform, and load data, followed by hypothesis testing using Python. 

### Key Insights:
- **Hypothesis**: Testing whether ride durations from the Loop to Oâ€™Hare Airport vary on rainy vs. non-rainy Saturdays.
- **Data Sources**: Competitor taxi ride data and weather data.
- **Tools Used**: SQL for data extraction, Python for analysis, hypothesis testing, and visualization.

## Sentiment Analysis for Movie Reviews

[Link to the Project](./Sentiment%20Analysis%20for%20Movie%20Reviews)

### Description:
The Film Junky Union tasked me with building a system to automatically detect negative reviews using sentiment analysis. This project focused on transforming text data into numerical representations and building classification models to predict review polarity (positive/negative).

### Key Insights:
- **Dataset**: IMDB movie reviews with polarity labels (positive and negative).
- **Target Metric**: F1 score with a threshold of 0.85 or higher.
- **Tools and Models Used**: Logistic Regression, TF-IDF, NLTK, and Gradient Boosting.
